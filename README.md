README: Video Watermarking System Based on Multi-Task Generative Adversarial Network (MTGAN)
Overview
This project implements a video watermarking system using a multi-task generative adversarial network (MTGAN). The system is designed to embed secret information, referred to as a watermark, into video frames while maintaining visual quality and ensuring robustness against various attacks such as compression and noise. The system consists of a generator for embedding and extracting the watermark and a discriminator for detecting watermarked videos.

Key Features
Generator (G): The generator is responsible for embedding secret images into video frames and later extracting them. It ensures that the watermark remains intact and detectable even after the video undergoes various transformations or attacks.
Discriminator (D): The discriminator is a 3D convolutional neural network that evaluates video frames to determine whether they contain a watermark. It acts as an adversary to the generator, promoting the development of more robust watermarking techniques.
Data Augmentation: To enhance the robustness and generalization of the watermarking process, the system applies random transformations such as horizontal flips and color perturbations to secret images during training.
Attacks Simulation: The system simulates real-world conditions by applying attacks like H.264 compression and noise addition to watermarked videos. This helps in testing and ensuring the robustness of the watermark.
Evaluation Metrics: The system uses several metrics to evaluate performance, including PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) for visual quality, and NC (Normalized Correlation) for watermark accuracy before and after attacks.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of deep learning concepts and frameworks.
Familiarity with Python and its scientific libraries.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using a Git client.
Install required libraries such as PyTorch, Torchvision, NumPy, Matplotlib, and TQDM, which are essential for running the system.
Configuration
Before running the system, configure parameters such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and directory paths for saving models, logs, and metrics. These configurations can typically be modified in a configuration file provided with the system.
Training the Model
To train the model, execute the main training script provided in the system. This script will:

Initialize the generator and discriminator networks.
Set up data loaders to handle video and secret image datasets.
Begin the training loop, which includes both training and validation phases.
Log training and validation metrics to monitor progress.
Save model checkpoints at specified intervals.
Visualize and store results for analysis.
Key Components
Generator Network:
Takes video frames and secret images as input.
Produces watermarked video frames and attempts to extract the secret images from them.
Aims to ensure that the watermark is visually undetectable and robust against attacks.
Discriminator Network:
Analyzes video frames to detect the presence of a watermark.
Works in opposition to the generator to improve the watermarking process.
Data Augmentation Techniques:
Enhance the diversity of training data by applying random transformations to secret images.
Simulated Attacks:
Include H.264 compression and noise addition to test the robustness of the watermarking system.
Evaluation Metrics:
Provide quantitative measures of the system's performance in terms of visual quality and watermark accuracy.
Results
Upon completion of training, the system saves the following:

Watermarked video frames and extracted secret images for each epoch.
Evaluation metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and NC values.
Visual results demonstrating the effectiveness of the watermarking process.
